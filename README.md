## Features

### :lock: · Improved privacy

I removed a lot of telemetry and if you use WinUtil and O&O ShutUp together with NitroWin, you'll basically have all possible telemetry options turned off.

### :sunglasses: · Reduced bloat

Another thing that this doesn't come with is bloat. But I still included everything you need for a normal Windows installation. If you're missing something or want something removed you can always do that later.

### :rocket: · More FPS

While I can't guarantee this one, it should definitely be better than a stock Windows install. I didn't make NitroWin for more FPS, but rather for the improved privacy.

### :metal: · No need to reinstall Windows

I'd still absolutely recommend reinstalling Windows but most of the tweaks work on already existing installations. You can probably apply all tweaks which aren't in the [answer file](assets/autounattend/autounattend.xml).

### :do_not_litter: · No custom branding

This mod doesn't come with any sort of custom branding to keep Windows as clean as possible.

### :shield: · No security features disabled

Unlike other custom Windows modifications, I'm not disabling anything security related.

### :mag: · Completely open source

This project is completely open source. Please note that Windows is not open source. (Why would you even think that?)

### :window: · Create an optimized Windows installation

This is the most obvious one, I don't think I have to say anything about that one.

## How do I use this?

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open up an elevated PowerShell prompt inside of the downloaded repository.
3. Run the following commands inside of that prompt:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force
   .\NitroWin
   ```

4. The GUI will open up and is ready for you to use.

### Create minimal ISO

If you want to build a minimal ISO, check out [my fork of WinUtil](https://github.com/Nitro4542/winutil). Create an ISO with MicroWin, just as you would with the regular WinUtil. The ISO will automatically contain the answer file and a copy of NitroWin. Note that the automatic user creation doesn't work because I had to remove the answer file from the original repo.

To run my fork of WinUtil, run the following inside an elevated PowerShell prompt:

```powershell
iex (irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitro4542/winutil/main/winutil.ps1")
```

### Tweaks

Almost all tweaks were taken from the [AtlasOS project](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas), which is licensed under [GPL 3.0](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/LICENSE). I won't change this project's license to GPL because I don't think you can copyright Windows registry files. Also, I rewrote the tweaks from their YAML format to the REG or PS1 format.

This project does not distribute modified Windows ISOs.
