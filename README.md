I think, it's really good for setting up a fresh Windows installation. But you can always do this afterwards as well.

## How do I use this?

### Modify exisiting installation

1. Download this repository.
2. Open up an elevated PowerShell prompt.
3. Run the following commands inside of that prompt:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force
   .\NitroWin
   ```

4. The GUI will open up and is ready for you to use.

### Create installation media

1. Create a Windows 11 installation media.
2. Download this repository.
3. Open up an elevated PowerShell prompt.
4. Run the following commands inside of that prompt:

   # Replace d:\ with the drive letter of your installation media
