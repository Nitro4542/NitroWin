## How do I use this?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install the [.NET 8.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) if you haven't already. You only need the desktop or the normal runtime, not both.

Go to the [latest GitHub release page](https://github.com/Nitro4542/NitroWin/releases/latest) and download NitroWin.exe from there and run it.

Create a normal Windows 11 installation media as usual, but place the autounattend.xml file generated by the NitroWin executable in the root of your installation media.

### Some tweaks fail to import

Some tweaks (in the System folder only) require you to import them with TrustedInstaller privileges. You can do this with [ExecTI](https://winaero.com/download-execti-run-as-trustedinstaller/).

However, this shouldn't be a problem if you're using the answer file, as there, they are run in a system context there.
