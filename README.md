</div>

## When do I use this?

It is recommended to use this while setting up a fresh Windows install.

Although, (almost) all Tweaks from NitroWin which aren't in the [answer file](assets/autounattend/autounattend.xml) can be imported into an existing Windows installation.

## How do I use this?

1. Download this repository.
2. Open up an elevated PowerShell prompt inside of the downloaded repository.
3. Run the following commands inside of that prompt:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force
   .\NitroWin
   ```

4. The GUI will open up and is ready for you to use.

### Tweaks

Almost all tweaks were taken from the [AtlasOS project](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas), which is licensed under [GPL 3.0](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/LICENSE). I won't change this project's license to GPL because I don't think you can copyright Windows registry files. Also, I rewrote the tweaks from their YAML format to the REG or PS1 format.

This project does not distribute modified Windows ISOs.
