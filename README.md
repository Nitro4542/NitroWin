## :books: · How do I use this?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install the [.NET 8.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) if you haven't already. You only need the desktop or the normal runtime, not both.

Go to the [latest GitHub release page](https://github.com/Nitro4542/NitroWin/releases/latest) and download NitroWin.exe from there and run it.

Create a normal Windows 11 installation media as usual, but place the autounattend.xml file from the NitroWin folder and the folder itself generated by the NitroWin executable in the root of your installation media.
